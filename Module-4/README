A waiting area in a barbershop has very limited space. There are three barbers, and two categories of customer: child and adult. Barbers 1 and 2 cut only the hair of adults, while barber 3 cuts only children’s hair. There are 8 waiting spaces. Customers must come alone, except that children must come with one parent; no one is allowed entry if there is no waiting space. One haircut takes 12 minutes, with 1 minute gap before the next customer. Once their hair is cut, customers leave the shop without re-entering the waiting area; children’s parents however remain in the waiting area until their child’s haircut is complete. The wall on the clock ticks every minute. In the case of a fire alarm, all customers must leave the shop in an orderly fashion.

Write and then simulate a program which replicates this activity. Interrupts should be used for adult or child requesting entry, and for the fire alarm. To ease testing, reduce each minute to one second, or a convenient time-slot. Seat occupancy should be indicated by LEDs.
